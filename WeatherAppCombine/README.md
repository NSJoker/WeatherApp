# Weather App

The app shows present weather information from the following cities using the OpenWeather APIs:

1. Gothenburg
2. Stockholm
3. Mountain View
4. London
5. New York
6. Berlin



The design for the app was inspired by a design in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1100826294536456295).

The Trapezoid shape for the rows was made using [quassum](https://quassum.github.io/SVG-to-SwiftUI/). I copied the SVG for Trapezoid from Figma and converted it to SwiftUI shape using this tool.

# Unit Tests
Unit tests are not written. In future we only need to write unit tests for the API services. In that case create a mock API service that confirms to the **Service** protocol that can publish a Mock WeatherInfo object.
